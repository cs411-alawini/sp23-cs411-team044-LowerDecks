## Project Summary

HFTracer is a web application that allows users to visualize high frequency trading (HFT) communications data obtained from publicly available FCC microwave and millimeter wave data. The application integrates with Google Earth to provide a visual representation of HFT-related communications and allows users to filter the results based on frequency band and location. Additionally, users can manually add HFT-related communications not found in the FCC data. In other words, we can find the start and end locations of HFT communcations from data on the FCC website, which we will use to visualize what parts of the country are communicating with each other in the HFT world.
