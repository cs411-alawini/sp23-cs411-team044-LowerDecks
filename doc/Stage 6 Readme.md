Here is the google drive shared folder link that contains 2 videos.
1. The Project Demo video
2. Stage 5 fixes for transactions and trigger implementation.

For the stage 5 fixes you can also refer to the /Code/server.js File Line 101 which contains 2 advanced queries and that is what is being shown in the video demo

Note: Even though in the video it shows localhost, we have it on GCP as well, but for the sake of convenience, we were using localhost connected to the GCP SQL server on the backend.
